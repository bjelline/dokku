> [!NOTE]
> The k3s plugin replaces the external [scheduler-kubernetes](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-scheduler-kubernetes) plugin. Users can continue to use the external plugin as necessary, but all future development will occur on the official core k3s plugin.

For multi-server support, Dokku provides the ability for users to setup a K3s cluster. As with all schedulers, it is set on a per-app basis. The scheduler can currently be overridden by running the following command:

```shell
dokku scheduler:set node-js-app selected k3s
```

As it is the default, unsetting the `selected` scheduler property is also a valid way to reset the scheduler.

```shell
dokku scheduler:set node-js-app k3s
```

## Usage

### Initializing a cluster

> [!WARNING]
> This command must be run as root

Clusters can be initialized via the `scheduler-k3s:initialize` command. This will start a k3s cluster on the Dokku node itself.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:initialize
```

By default, the k3s installation can run both app and system workloads. For clusters where app workloads are run on distinct worker nodes, initialize the cluster with the `--taint-scheduling` flag, which will allow _only_ Critical cluster components on the k3s control-plane nodes.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:initialize --taint-scheduling
```

By default, Dokku will attempt to auto-detect the IP address of the server. In cases where the auto-detected IP address is incorrect, an override may be specified via the `--server-ip` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:initialize --server-ip 192.168.20.15
```

Dokku's k3s integration natively uses `Traefik` as it's ingress load balancer via [Traefik's CRDs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/), but a cluster can be set to use `nginx` via the [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) project. Switching to nginx will result in any `nginx` plugin settings being respected, either by turning them into annotations or creating a custom server snippet.

To change the ingress, set the `--ingress-class` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:initialize --ingress-class nginx
```

### Adding nodes to the cluster

> [!WARNING]
> The `dokku` user _must_ be able to ssh onto the server in order to connect nodes to the cluster. The remote user must be root or have sudo enabled, or the install will fail.

#### Adding a worker node

Nodes that run app workloads can be added via the `scheduler-k3s:cluster-add` command. This will ssh onto the specified server, install k3s, and join it to the current Dokku node in worker mode. Workers are typically used to run app workloads.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add  ssh://root@worker-1.example.com
```

If the server isn't in the `known_hosts` file, the connection will fail. This can be bypassed by setting the `--insecure-allow-unknown-hosts` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add --insecure-allow-unknown-hosts ssh://root@worker-1.example.com
```

By default, Dokku will attempt to auto-detect the IP address of the Dokku server for the remote server to connect to. In cases where the auto-detected IP address is incorrect, an override may be specified via the `--server-ip` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add --server-ip 192.168.20.15 ssh://root@worker-1.example.com
```

#### Adding a server node

> [!NOTE]
> Only the initial Dokku server will be properly configured for push deployment, and should be considered your git remote. Additional server nodes are for ensuring high-availability of the K3s etcd state. Ensure this server is properly backed up and restorable or deployments will not work.

Server nodes are typically used to replicate the cluster state, and it is recommended to have an odd number of nodes spread across several availability zones (datacenters in close proximity within a region). This allows for higher availability in the event of a cluster failure. Server nodes run control-plane services such as the traefik load balancer and the etcd backing store.

Server nodes can also be added with the `scheduler-k3s:cluster-add` command by specifying `--role server`. This will ssh onto the specified server, install k3s, and join it to the current Dokku node in server mode.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add  --role server ssh://root@server-1.example.com
```

Server nodes allow any workloads to be scheduled on them by default, in addition to the control-plane, etcd, and the scheduler itself. To avoid app workloads being scheduled on your control-plane, use the `--taint-scheduling` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add --role server --taint-scheduling ssh://root@server-1.example.com
```

If the server isn't in the `known_hosts` file, the connection will fail. This can be bypassed by setting the `--insecure-allow-unknown-hosts` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add --role server --insecure-allow-unknown-hosts ssh://root@server-1.example.com
```

By default, Dokku will attempt to auto-detect the IP address of the Dokku server for the remote server to connect to. In cases where the auto-detected IP address is incorrect, an override may be specified via the `--server-ip` flag:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:cluster-add --role server --server-ip 192.168.20.15 ssh://root@server-1.example.com
```

#### Changing the network interface

When attaching an worker or server node, the K3s plugin will look at the IP associated with the `eth0` interface and use that to connect the new node to the cluster. To change this, set the `network-interface` property to the appropriate value.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global network-interface eth1
```

### Changing deploy timeouts

By default, app deploys will timeout after 300s. To customize this value, set the `deploy-timeout` property via `scheduler-k3s:set`:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app deploy-timeout 60s
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app deploy-timeout
```

The `deploy-timeout` property can also be set globally. The global default is `300s`.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global deploy-timeout 60s
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global deploy-timeout
```

### Customizing the namespace

By default, app deploys will run against the `default` Kubernetes namespace. To customize this value, set the `namespace` property via `scheduler-k3s:set`:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app namespace lollipop
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app namespace
```

The `namespace` property can also be set globally. The global default is `default`.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global namespace 60s
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global namespace
```

### Enabling rollback on failure

By default, app deploys do not rollback on failure. To enable this functionality, set the `rollback-on-failure` property via `scheduler-k3s:set`:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app rollback-on-failure true
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app rollback-on-failure
```

The `rollback-on-failure` property can also be set globally. The global default is `false`.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global rollback-on-failure false
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global rollback-on-failure
```

### Using image pull secrets

When authenticating against a registry via `registry:login`, the scheduler-k3s plugin will authenticate all servers in the cluster against the registry specified. If desired, an image pull secret can be used instead. To customize this value, set the `image-pull-secrets` property via `scheduler-k3s:set`:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app image-pull-secrets lollipop
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app image-pull-secrets
```

The `image-pull-secrets` property can also be set globally. The global default is empty string, and k3s will use Dokku's locally configured `~/.docker/config.json` for any private registry pulls.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global image-pull-secrets 60s
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global image-pull-secrets
```

### Enabling letsencrypt integration

By default, letsencrypt is disabled and https port mappings are ignored. To enable, set the `letsencrypt-email-prod` or `letsencrypt-email-stag` property with the `--global` flag:

```shell
# set the value for prod
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global letsencrypt-email-prod automated@dokku.sh

# set the value for stag
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global letsencrypt-email-stag automated@dokku.sh
```

After enabling and rebuilding, all apps with an `http:80` port mapping will have a corresponding `https:443` added and ssl will be automatically enabled. All http requests will then be redirected to https.

### Customizing the letsencrypt server

The letsencrypt integration is set to the production letsencrypt server by default. This can be changed on an app-level by setting the `letsencrypt-server` property with the `scheduler-k3s:set` command

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app letsencrypt-server staging
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set node-js-app letsencrypt-server
```

The `image-pull-secrets` property can also be set globally. The global default is `production`.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global letsencrypt-server staging
```

The default value may be set by passing an empty value for the option.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global letsencrypt-server staging
```

### Customizing Resource Annotations

Dokku injects certain resources into each created resource by default, but it may be necessary to inject others for tighter integration with third-party tools. The `scheduler-k3s:annotations:set` command can be used to perform this task. The command takes an app name and a required `--resource-type` flag.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:annotations:set node-js-app annotation.key annotation.value --resource-type deployment
```

If not specified, the annotation will be applied to all processes within an app, though it may be further scoped to a specific process type via the `--process-type` flag. 

> [!NOTE]
> The cron ID is used as the process type if your app deploys any cron tasks

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:annotations:set node-js-app annotation.key annotation.value --resource-type deployment --process-type web
```

To unset an annotation, pass an empty value:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:annotations:set node-js-app annotation.key --resource-type deployment
dokku scheduler-k3s:annotations:set node-js-app annotation.key --resource-type deployment --process-type web
```

The following resource types are supported:

- `certificate`
- `cronjob`
- `deployment`
- `ingress`
- `job`
- `pod`
- `secret`
- `service`
- `serviceaccount`
- `traefik_ingressroute`
- `traefik_middleware`

### Using kubectl remotely

> [!WARNING]
> Certain ports must be open for interacting with the remote kubernets api. Refer to the [K3s networking documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=debian#networking) for the required open ports between servers prior to running the command.

By default, Dokku assumes that all it controls all actions on the cluster, and thus does not expose the `kubectl` binary for administrators. To interact with kubectl, you will need to retrieve the `kubeconfig` for the cluster and configure your client to use that configuration.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:show-kubeconfig
```

### Interacting with an external Kubernetes cluster

While the k3s scheduler plugin is designed to work with a Dokku-managed k3s cluster, Dokku can be configured to interact with any Kubernetes cluster by setting the global `kubeconfig-path` to a path to a custom kubeconfig on the Dokku server. This property is only available at a global level.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global kubeconfig-path /path/to/custom/kubeconfig
```

To set the default value, omit the value from the `scheduler-k3s:set` call:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global kubeconfig-path
```

The default value for the `kubeconfig-path` is the k3s kubeconfig located at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`.

### Customizing the Kubernetes context

When interacting with a custom Kubeconfig, the `kube-context` property can be set to specify a specific context within the kubeconfig to use. This property is available only at the global leve.

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global kube-context lollipop
```

To set the default value, omit the value from the `scheduler-k3s:set` call:

```shell
dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global kube-context
```

The default value for the `kube-context` is an empty string, and will result in Dokku using the current context within the kubeconfig.

## Scheduler Interface

The following sections describe implemented and unimplemented scheduler functionality for the `k3s` scheduler.

### Implemented Commands and Triggers

This plugin implements various functionality through `plugn` triggers to integrate with Docker for running apps on a single server. The following functionality is supported by the `scheduler-k3s` plugin.

- `apps:clone`
- `apps:destroy`
- `apps:rename`
- `cron`
- `enter`
- `deploy`
- healthchecks
       - Due to Kubernetes limitations, only a single healthcheck is supported for each of the `liveness`, `readiness`, and `startup` healthchecks
       - Due to Kubernetes limitations, content checks are not supported
       - Ports specified in the `app.json` are ignored in favor of the container port on the port mapping detected
- `logs`
- `ps:stop`
- `run`
       - The `scheduler-post-run` trigger is not always triggered
- `run:detached`
- `run:list`

### Unimplemented command functionality

- `run:logs`
- `ps:inspect`

The following Dokku functionality is not implemented at this time.

- `vector` log integration
- persistent storage

### Logging support

App logs for the `logs` command are fetched by Dokku from running containers via the `kubectl` cli. Persisting logs via Vector is not implemented at this time. Users may choose to configure the Vector Kubernetes integration directly by following [this guide](https://vector.dev/docs/setup/installation/platforms/kubernetes/).

### Supported Resource Management Properties

The `k3s` scheduler supports a minimal list of resource _limits_ and _reservations_. The following properties are supported:

#### Resource Limits

> [!NOTE]
> Cron tasks retrieve resource limits based on the computed cron task ID. If unspecified, the default will be 1 CPU and 512m RAM.

- cpu: is specified in number of CPUs a process can access.
- memory: should be specified with a suffix of `b` (bytes), `k` (kilobytes), `m` (megabytes), `g` (gigabytes). Default unit is `m` (megabytes).

#### Resource Reservations

> [!NOTE]
> Cron tasks retrieve resource reservations based on the computed cron task ID. If unspecified, the default will be 1 CPU and 512m RAM.

- cpu: is specified in number of CPUs a process can access.
- memory: should be specified with a suffix of `b` (bytes), `k` (kilobytes), `m` (megabytes), `g` (gigabytes). Default unit is `m` (megabytes).
